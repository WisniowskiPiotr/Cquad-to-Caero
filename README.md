Please read [Static stability calculation of aircraft](./Documents/StaticStabilityCalculationOfAircraft.pdf) for explained usage of this software.
Additionaly read [Dynamic stability calculation of aircraft](./Documents/DynamicStabilityAnalysisOfAirplane.pdf) for futher reading regarding usagde of results of this analysis.

Main method is in Cquad_to_Aero.cpp. Typical parameter values are set by default.

Default values for parameters:
- Values uset by SET2 Nastran data for defining the prism containing the set for splining structural grid points to aerodynamic grid points. 
    SPLINEL=-0.1
    SPLINEU=1.1
    ZMIN=0
    ZMAX=0

- Division of each CAERO1 to a number of aerodynamic grid points. Used for mesh size dependency validation.
    NCHORD=1
    NSPAN=1

- SPLINE6 Nastran entry parameters
    DZ=0 -Linear attachment flexibility.
    FPS=FPS6 -Method for the spline fit. Either FPS3 or FPS6.

Typical usage:
Cquad_to_Aero.exe Whole_aero.bdf NSPAN=1 SPLINEL=-0.1

Whole_aero.bdf is an example of input file
